Subject: Let’s Spice Up Our Communication!

Dear Team,

I hope you are doing well.

A moment is being taken to remind everyone of the importance of maintaining professional conduct during our video conferences.
It has been observed that some team members are not adhering to the expected social etiquette,
 which can impact the overall effectiveness of our meetings.
To ensure we’re all on the same page and maintaining a respectful, collaborative environment, 

I kindly ask everyone to keep the following points in mind:

Punctuality: Please ensure you join meetings on time. If you anticipate being late, kindly notify the team in advance.
 Starting on time is crucial to respecting everyone’s schedules.

Camera & Audio: Keep your camera on during meetings to encourage engagement. Also, please remember to mute your microphone when not speaking to avoid background noise. This helps ensure that everyone can hear and contribute effectively.

Background Noise: Be mindful of your surroundings. If possible, find a quiet space for the meeting to minimize distractions. 
If this isn't feasible, using headphones or a noise-canceling mic can make a big difference.

Preparedness: Come to the meeting prepared. 
Review the agenda and any relevant materials ahead of time so that we can make the most of our time together.
 This helps avoid last-minute scrambling and ensures everyone is ready to contribute.


Respectful Participation: Be attentive and engaged in the conversation. Avoid side activities like eating, checking emails during the meeting.
 Let’s give our full attention to the discussion.


Interrupting Others: Please be mindful of allowing everyone to finish speaking before responding.
 Interrupting can disrupt the flow of conversation and may cause frustration.
 Let’s keep it respectful and give everyone a chance to share their thoughts.

Avoiding Arguments: If disagreements arise, let’s handle them respectfully and professionally. 
Disagreements are natural, but we need to ensure they don’t escalate into unproductive arguments that disrupt the meeting.

By upholding these simple guidelines, we can create a more professional, productive, and enjoyable atmosphere for everyone. 
I trust that everyone will take this feedback to heart and work towards improving our group dynamics.

Thank you for your cooperation, and as always, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,
