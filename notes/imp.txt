Explanation of the Test Cases:
testProcessPayment:

Simulates a POST request to the /processPayment endpoint.
Verifies that the response status is 201 Created and the response JSON matches the mocked PaymentResponse.
testGetPaymentStatus:

Simulates a GET request to the /getPaymentStatus/{orderKey} endpoint.
Verifies that the response status is 200 OK and the response JSON matches the mocked PaymentResponse.
Both tests validate the controller's behavior by mocking the service layer to ensure proper integration between the controller and the service.
